# Artificial Intelligence - Lab 4

### About

This program uses the Naive Bayes method to learn a classifier for text from training data, and use a test set to evaluate the quality of the classifier. This assignment was created by Professor Ernest Davis at NYU for CSCI-UA.0472 Artificial Intelligence. Code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/bxw201/ai_lab4).

### How to run

First, be sure that Python is installed in the environment where the program is being run. To check, run `python --version` in your CLI.

To run the program, enter `python naive_bayes_model.py [corpus_file_name] [N]` where `corpus_file_name` is the name of the file storing the corpus of biographies and `N` is the size of the training set.

Two example corpuses can be found already in `bioCorpus.txt` and `tinyCorpus.txt`.
